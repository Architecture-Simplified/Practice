# Data Directory

This directory is intended for storing data files used by your project.

## Structure
- `raw/` - Raw, unprocessed data files
- `processed/` - Cleaned and processed data files
- `external/` - Data from external sources

## Note
- Add `.gitkeep` files to maintain empty directories in git
- Consider using `.gitignore` to exclude large data files from version control
- For large datasets, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage)
